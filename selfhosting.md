# Self hosting the bot
In order to self host the bot, you need to learn some important stuff
## Private Commands (Only admins)
### !verify
This will make a verification portal
### !tktpanel
This will make a ticket portal
### !rr
This will make button self roles (reaction roles)
### !ping
This will tell the ping of the bot
### !brr <time> <mentions>
This is a command which when used, should be used along some player mentions and a time for example `!brr 2m @Sypher @Bablucopter @Aryan`. This command will choose one random user mention and timeout it for whatever time you have mentioned like as in example I did "2m" which means "2 minutes".
### !steal \<emoji\> \<name\>
This will allow you to steal emojis from different servers (better discord links work as well)
### !eval \`\`\`js \<code\> \`\`\`
This will allow you to complile any nodejs code direct from the bot (message variables will work as well)
## config.json
IN config.json most of the values are the ids but there can be others too. Use common sense for it.
## Hosting
I say use replit, heroku (about to die), or any host which allows nodejs applications
