## Logics
### Vote Command
The logic for vote command has been put in [`vote-logic.js`](https://github.com/cashlycash/CodeTech-Discord-Bot/blob/main/vote-logic.js) please view it and read all comments for better understanding
### config.json
The main reason I used [`config.json`](https://github.com/cashlycash/CodeTech-Discord-Bot/blob/main/config.json) is so that incase we need to use this bot in a new server, I won't need to go to every file in code and change stuff. I can just change in config.json and rehost it (will save time) + people who want to use this bot in there own server can do so easily as well
## Self hosting
If you want to use this bot in your server then please visit [`selfhosting.md`](https://github.com/cashlycash/CodeTech-Discord-Bot/blob/main/selfhosting.md)
